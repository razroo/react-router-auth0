Reach out to me at [x.com/razroo_chief](https://x.com/razroo_chief) or email me at charlie@razroo.com if have any problems. If I don't address within 24 hrs, create an issue here to grab my attention. I know how annoying it can be to be working on a product in which your livlihood/business depends and the core authentication layer not working as expected.
